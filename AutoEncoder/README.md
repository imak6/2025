# **# Fraud detection using AutoEncoders**

**synth_data_loader.py**:

* I am using data provided by Kaggle, and instead of downloading in a traditional way, I am using "kagglehub" which is one of the options provided by kaggle to use the dataset.

* Load the data and perform all the required preprocessing to be used for training/testing purposes in the later stages.

**f_d_ae_functions.py**: **Module in which AutoEncoders are implemented**

* Now import the functions built in synth_data_loader module to load the data as well as import other required libraries to build the model.

* Comments have been added in the modules that explain what each snippet does.
